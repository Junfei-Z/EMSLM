Their overall sales have been consistently growing at a rate of 3-to-5 percent each year since then. In particular, the Aquatic Pavilion outlet in Harbor Town experienced even more significant growth, securing the title of the most frequented animal store in the United States the previous year. In contrast, our two Zorblatt outlets in Harbor Town have recorded a consistent drop in sales during the same duration. It is evident that we must promptly start featuring our own advertisements in Rare Pets Digest and other popular animal publications. If we take this step, we can confidently anticipate a reversal in this recent trend of decreasing sales and return to profitability.\""]}
